DarkPrompts
-----------

A slightly better tool for generating random prompts.

DarkPrompt
==========
DarkPrompt reads lines from a file and/or a text input, combines them together, optionally strips out comments and blank lines, and then selects a random line for use in generating your prompt based on a seed input.  It also has a "prefix" and "suffix" field so you can easily include additional information with each prompt or wrap it inside a weight.  For example a prefix of '(' and a suffix of ':1.2)' could return a string: ```(walking a dog:1.2)``` from an file named ```activities.txt``` that contains a line ```walking a dog```.

Unlike several other ComfyUI projects, the box is somewhat more compact, gives you an easy way to combine file and text sources for prompt generation, and most importantly it re-reads the files after every prompt generation so you don't have to restart ComfyUI after editing wildcard files.

DarkCombiner
============
DarkCombiner accepts up to 7 text inputs and combines them with an optional delimiter (\n by default) with a string output.  This allows you to easily combine multiple DarkPrompt nodes to generate complex prompts.

DarkLoraTagLoader
=================
DarkLoraTagLoader is a modified version of LoraTagLoader from https://github.com/badjeff/comfyui_lora_tag_loader that also outputs a LORA_STACK of detected LoRAs for use in things like the Efficient Loader for doing XY Plots.
LoraTagLoader is licensed under the freedom-hating GPL v3 license which is why the code for DarkLoraTagLoader is under the gplv3 folder.

DarkFaceIndexShuffle
====================
[ComfyUI-Reactor-Node](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor-node) supports swapping faces by providing a CSV index of faces (i.e. "0,1,2,3,4,5").
DarkFaceIndexShuffle allows you to enter an array of faces, shuffle the array based on a seed, and stick the result into the Reactor input_faces_index input.
This allows you to randomize faces and order of friends in the scene generated by your prompts.

Installation Using ComfyUI Manager
==================================
DarkPrompts should now show up in the list of modules in ComfyUI Manager.
If not, you can copy the URL of this repo and paste it into the "Install via Git URL" box and restart ComfyUI.

Installation into ComfyUI
=========================
Go into your custom_nodes directory and run a ```git clone https://github.com/darkpixel/darkprompts.git``` and then restart ComfyUI.
